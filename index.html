        <h2 id="mlc">My Life Comix!</h2><br>
        My Life Comix is a comic founded by me in Primary 5, inspired by teachers. The main character is a student named Leo and a crazy teacher named Ms Bing. Through science and craziness, we travel through time (not always) and have whopping adventures!<br>
        Since 2013, we transitioned from paper to computer. Since 2014, we started making books and videos too. Aside from the weekly main comic strip, we also have adventure stories such as Realities.<br>

        If you want to check out ALL the comics, from start to end, see the latest website. The comics aren't synced to the older ones, but the comics were indeed migrated to the newer ones. Thus, check out the latest website for all up-to-date information.
